Hey there!

Welcome to my freshly cooked blog. Everything and anything that you'll find here will probably be about some personal and general matters occuring in my life -- _opinionated in flavor!_ Mostly about programming, technology, entrepreneurship, "law school" and of course, all that the universe cast and will be cast upon me.

I've been planning to do this for a while back after I scrapped my previous blog, but I had to plan things. I needed to approach this in a very different manner, but if you knew me, this isn't something I'm not used to. There's going to be a certain point that I might not be able to make updates, but that's just me. My schedule is pretty tight right now, I'll do my best to find time to write for a blog no one reads.

I had a lot of neat ideas needed to be written, but unfortunately, I did __not__ wrote them. They went straight down to the deepest parts of my mind and then vanished. poof. _Awesome ain't it?_

Nah.

So yeah, I need to step back. I'm always jumping forward eyes closed. I keep hitting concrete walls. Things aren't adding up nicely, and things that I regard as happiness stings me back unknowingly. Let's just say it's time for things to be better and be better executed.

###Law school? Dafuq.

Yup. Maybe I'll tackle this some other time, and as well as other things.

So let's end this post here, I need to start flipping pages on those friggin'ly thick law books.
